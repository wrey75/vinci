package com.oxande.vinci.antlr4;

/**
 * This package is dedicated to ANTLR4 for storing the classes related to
 * the Lexer and parser (grammar) of the language.
 *
 * NOTE: the "vinci" code has 2 levels of compilation including a pre-compiler
 * to check for special compilation directives (like in C). Basically, the code
 * generated can be for debug purposes or release with some macros.
 *
 * Macros can be defined and used in the code. Basically, some special identifiers are
 * replaced "live" by the parser.
